`wad` (Where's All the Development?) is a version control system with the goal
of simplicity and predictability. The name is homage to [id Software's WAD file
format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_WAD).

Concepts:
commits, tags, and head
the changeset and ignoring files
linear history
restacking

`wad list`

`wad new list bla bla bla bla`

`wad new commit bla bla bla bla`

`wad jump <list or commit>`

`wad restack <base`
