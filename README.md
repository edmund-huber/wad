wad
=

`wad` (Where's All the Development?) implements "the good parts" of git.

The name is homage to [id Software's WAD file
format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_WAD).

These are its goals:
* wad is simple to use.
* wad is simple to understand.
* wad is self-contained and has no dependencies other than Python 2.
